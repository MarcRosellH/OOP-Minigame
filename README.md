# OOP-Minigame
This repository is related to the Bachelor's Degree Thesis
The project is about simulating a bunch of entities with a specific behaviour in order to derive metrics to compare the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm with the Data-Oriented Design one.
The amount of entities simulated and the amount of time done can be changed by setting new values for MAX_TIME and MAX_OBJECTS macros.

The libraries initially added to the repository are:
[OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org)
[GLFW](https://www.glfw.org)
[GLAD](https://gen.glad.sh)
[AssImp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)
[stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
